  adds a table of contents (TOC) to your Markdown files, either online or from the command line.
It supports **Gitlab** and **GitHub** styles, and can generate anchors to comply with **Bitbucket Server**
(and its lack of proper markdown support using the generic profile), **[dev.to](https://dev.to)**,
**[hashnode](https://hashnode.com)**, and more!

Thanks to small comments (in HTML or liquid tags), it can also detect previously generated TOC,
so you can run it every time you change your README without worries. In other words, it is **idempotent** ü§©.

It supports English, French, and most **Latin languages**, but not Cyrillic or Chinese!

## Usage

### Online

Go to https:// .derlin.ch !

### From the command line

Having [homebrew](https://brew.sh)? Install   with:
```bash
brew install derlin/ / 
```

Otherwise, the **JVM jar** can be found in the [releases](https://github.com/derlin/ /releases).
If you want the latest version, check the [nightly release](https://github.com/derlin/ /releases/nightly).

Native executables for Linux, Mac and Windows are available for releases only.
See [About native executables](#about-native-executables) for more info.

Once installed, run:
```bash
# Generic, e.g. BitBucket Server
  readme.md --inplace
# GitLab
  -p gitlab readme.md --inplace # or
  --no-anchors readme.md --inplace
# GitHub
  -p github readme.md --inplace # or
  --no-anchors --no-concat-spaces readme.md --inplace
# DevTo
  -p devto
# Hashnode
  -p hashnode

# Piping from stdin
cat README.md |  
```
NOTE: if you are downloaded the jar, replace ` ` above with `java -jar  -jvm-*.jar`.
If you installed the native executable manually, replace ` ` above with `<path/to/executable>`.

The tool will output the transformed file depending on the following options (mutually exclusive):

* default: output to stdout;
* `-i`/`--inplace`: replace input file (incompatible with reading from stdin);
* `-o`/`--output`: output to the specified file.

**IMPORTANT**: do not use bash redirects with the same file (input = output), it won't work as you expect!

If you have a doubt, run   with `-h` or `--help`:
```text

### About native executables

Native executables are attached to each release.

**Linux**

On Linux, you may just have to run `chmod +x` before use.

**Mac**

On Mac, you need to run `chmod +x` and then execute the script once.
It will be blocked, but you can allow it anyway by going to *System Preferences* > *Security* and pressing "Allow Anyway".
Once done, re-execute   and click "Open" on the popup.
You are good to go.

**Windows**

On Windows, right-click on the executable and press *Properties*.
In the general tab under *Security* at the bottom, tick "Unblock".
You can now execute it in the CMD. Note that it may take a while to launch, but only the first time ;)

## TOC flavors (profiles)

This tool supports some profiles out-of-the-box: GitLab, GitLab 17 (version 17.0 and above), GitHub, and dev.to.
The Generic profile is perfect for platforms such as BitBucket Server which do not generate anchor links on their own.
Simply choose your flavor using the profile option (`-p`/`--profile`).

It is however highly customizable, and the options can also fit many other platforms.
Here is a breakdown of the options (that differ from the defaults) to use for each.

### Built-in profiles

* *Generic* ‚Üí generate anchors (e.g. BitBucket Server)
* *GitLab* ‚Üí concat spaces, do not generate anchors
* *GitLab 17* ‚Üí do not concat spaces, do not generate anchors
* *GitHub* ‚Üí do not concat spaces, do not generate anchors
* *dev.to* ‚Üí concat spaces, do not generate anchors, comment style = liquid, anchors algorithm = DEVTO
* *hashnode* ‚Üí concat spaces, anchors prefix = "heading-", anchors algorithm = HASHNODE

### Other platforms

* *BitBucket.org* (supports the `[TOC]` directly) ‚Üí anchors algorithm = DEVTO, anchors prefix = `markdown-header-`
  ‚ùó will break if you use code in your headings (backticks) - open an issue if you want support :)

If you have more ideas or platforms you want to use, let me know by opening an issue üòä.

### Still not fitting your use case?

If no combination of available options fits your Markdown processor, simply use the *generate anchors* (or use the *BitBucket* profile).

Since the anchors are manually added to the markdown, the TOC will work as long as `<a>` tags with a `name` parameter
are supported. If you are working with a platform supporting liquid tags instead (e.g. forem), set the *comment style* option to LIQUID
(or use the *dev.to* profile).

## TOC placement

You can control where the table of content will be inserted by adding the marker (on its own line):
```text
[TOC]
```

Any header above the marker will be ignored. The option "*trim toc*" (turned on by default) means that if
you have e.g. only level-2 headers below the marker, the TOC will be indented as if those were level 1 headers.

---

## About the code

### Motivation

I got the motivation from the lack of existing tools supporting **BitBucket Server**.
As of version 6, the BitBucket processor doesn't insert any ID or name to the HTML headers generated from markdown, meaning there is no way
of targeting a specific header without manually adding an anchor of the form:
```html
<a name="some-heading"></a>
```

I found [this blog](https://rderik.com/blog/generate-table-of-contents-with-anchors-for-markdown-file-vim-plugin/)
mentioning a Vim plugin doing it for you, but this requires Vim (obviously) and the anchors support lives in a
specific branch that is unlikely to be maintained.

I am quite fond of [GitHub Wiki TOC generator](https://ecotrust-canada.github.io/markdown-toc/)
(you should see the inspiration here), and wanted something similar but more flexible
(not only targeting GitHub and supporting symbols and diacritics).


### Kotlin all the way!

This project was also a great way to play with Kotlin MPP (Multi-Platform Projects).

The code is split between:
* a common module handling the TOC generation, and defining the default options;
* a JVM module with a [Clikt](https://ajalt.github.io/clikt/) CLI;
* a JS module that is imported into a static HTML page.

![Kotlin MultiPlatform Overview](other/kotlin-multiplatform-overview.png)

Tests are implemented in the common module, with one exception: some additional tests are located in the JVM module,
because I wanted to load test files and reading files is not supported in common...

### Build and run

To build the project, use the custom target ` `, which will produce the JVM fat jar and copy the compiled
js scripts into the directory `html/scripts`:
```bash
./gradlew  
```
The `html` folder can then be deployed as a static site.


To run tests, use `check` or `allTests`:
```bash
./gradlew allTests
```

## About the license

I chose the [Common Clause](https://commonsclause.com) for this project,
just because I had a very bad experience once, where someone took one of my projects
as is, added adverts and republished it under his own name.

I know most of the Open Source community isn't like that, but   is unlikely
to be used in a commercial product anyway. Thus, the license is only here to ensure
no one will suddenly make a non-free   clone.

If you have any problem with this, feel free to share your thoughts in an issue,
I will be glad to discuss (and maybe revisit) it!

Until then, please to do whatever you want with  , as long as your
heart is pure.


DeFi AI Integration Platform
Overview
This project integrates Decentralized Finance (DeFi) with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to create an advanced platform that supports lending, staking, yield farming, automated market making (AMM), and decentralized governance. The goal is to leverage AI models for enhanced decision-making and optimize various DeFi operations, including risk management, interest rates, staking rewards, and liquidity provision.

This system combines on-chain smart contracts with off-chain AI models via oracles to bring dynamic decision-making and adaptability to the DeFi ecosystem. The AI layer can influence parameters such as interest rates, staking rewards, collateral management, and liquidity pool strategies.

Key Features
1. AI-Driven Lending and Borrowing
AI Model Integration: AI algorithms assess borrower risk profiles, adjust interest rates, and determine lending conditions.
Dynamic Loan Terms: Loan terms such as interest rates and collateral requirements are adjusted based on the borrower‚Äôs credit score, behavior, and market conditions predicted by AI models.
2. AI-Based Staking and Rewards
AI predictions help optimize staking rewards by dynamically adjusting rates based on market conditions, user behavior, and staking patterns.
Dynamic Rewards: Instead of fixed staking rewards, the AI continuously optimizes rewards to incentivize long-term participation and liquidity provision.
3. Automated Market Making (AMM)
The platform utilizes AI-powered AMM strategies to optimize the liquidity pool. AI models predict demand and supply trends to adjust the price curve and liquidity allocation.
Optimal Price Curves: AI dynamically adjusts the price curves for various token pairs in liquidity pools based on market trends and volume prediction.
4. AI for Risk Management
Collateral Liquidation: AI models continuously monitor the market to predict price volatility and adjust collateralization ratios.
Real-time Risk Evaluation: AI models provide real-time evaluation of liquidity and risk exposure for lenders and borrowers.
5. Decentralized Governance
Token-based Governance: Platform participants can govern key parameters (e.g., interest rates, rewards, risk management rules) using governance tokens. AI models assist in providing data-driven insights for governance decisions.
AI-Assisted Voting: AI models analyze trends and vote proposals to suggest optimal governance decisions.
6. Off-chain AI Integration with Oracles
Oracles: Off-chain data from AI models is fetched and fed into the smart contracts using oracles. These oracles provide secure and real-time data from AI models for decision-making within the DeFi ecosystem.
Data Feeds: Oracles provide data on AI-generated predictions, market conditions, credit scores, and more.
System Architecture
The system consists of several key components working together:

1. Smart Contracts (On-Chain)
Lending Contract: Manages the creation and repayment of loans with dynamic interest rates and collateral management.
Staking Contract: Manages staking, rewards distribution, and interaction with liquidity pools.
Governance Contract: Manages decentralized voting and governance proposals.
AMM Contract: Implements the automated market-making strategy using AI data.
2. Off-chain AI Model
AI Prediction Model: Uses machine learning algorithms to predict borrower behavior, market trends, and liquidity needs.
Credit Scoring System: Assesses borrower risk and predicts interest rates and loan terms.
Market Analysis: Analyzes liquidity needs, staking patterns, and asset price predictions.
3. Oracles
Oracles securely feed AI-driven data and market conditions to the smart contracts for real-time decision-making.
Example Data: AI model predictions, market volatility, credit scores, collateral values.

Integration with Off-Chain AI Models
How AI and Oracles Interact with Smart Contracts
AI Model: Off-chain, the AI model performs analysis based on various inputs, such as borrower behavior, market trends, and liquidity demands. This could include:

Loan risk prediction.
Market volatility analysis.
Liquidity pool optimization.
Oracles: The AI model sends predictions or data to the smart contracts using oracles. The oracle provides secure off-chain data to the on-chain contracts, enabling the system to make dynamic decisions based on real-time information.

Data examples:
AI-generated credit scores.
AI market trend predictions.
Dynamic staking reward rates.
Future Roadmap
AI Model Integration: Integrating real-world machine learning models and predictive analytics into the DeFi ecosystem.
Cross-Chain Interoperability: Extend the platform to work across multiple blockchains, allowing for broader liquidity and participation.
Advanced Governance: Implement AI-assisted decentralized governance systems for voting on proposals and managing protocol upgrades.
Insurance Protocol: Develop decentralized insurance products powered by AI predictions for risk mitigation.

2. AI-Based Staking and Rewards Contract
This contract adjusts staking rewards dynamically based on the AI model's prediction of market conditions.

How to Deploy and Use
Prerequisites
Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
Truffle/Hardhat: Install Truffle or Hardhat to compile and deploy smart contracts.
Metamask: A browser extension that acts as a wallet and allows interaction with the Ethereum blockchain.
Ganache: Use Ganache for local Ethereum blockchain testing or deploy to a public testnet like Rinkeby.
Steps to Deploy
Install dependencies:
bash
npm install
Compile contracts:
If using Truffle:

bash
truffle compile
If using Hardhat:

bash
npx hardhat compile
Deploy to a testnet: Update the deployment scripts to use the correct contract address for the AI model and oracle network. Deploy using Truffle or Hardhat.

Interact with Contracts: Use Web3.js or Ethers.js to interact with the deployed contracts from a front-end DApp or through the console.

Testing the Platform
To test the platform, you can write unit tests to validate contract functionality using frameworks such as Mocha, Chai, Truffle, or Hardhat.

Example Test Scenario:
Lending: Test if loans are created with dynamic interest rates based on credit scores.
Staking: Test if staking rewards are calculated and distributed based on AI-driven reward rates.
Example:

javascript
const { expect } = require("chai");
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

describe("Lending Contract", function () {
  let lendingContract;
  let aiModel;
  let borrower;

  beforeEach(async function () {
    // Deploy AI model and lending contract
    aiModel = await (await ethers.getContractFactory("AIModel")).deploy();
    lendingContract = await (await ethers.getContractFactory("Lending")).deploy(aiModel.address);
    borrower = await ethers.getSigner();
  });

  it("should create a loan with dynamic interest rates", async function () {
    const amount = ethers.utils.parseEther("10");
    await lendingContract.createLoan(amount);

    const loan = await lendingContract.loans(borrower.address);
    expect(loan.amount).to.equal(amount);
    expect(loan.interestRate).to.be.above(0);
  });
});
Future Enhancements
1. Cross-Chain Interoperability
Integrate the platform with multiple blockchains to enable cross-chain liquidity provision, lending, and staking.
2. AI-Enhanced Portfolio Management
Enable the platform to optimize user portfolios based on AI-driven risk management strategies.
3. Integration with DeFi Yield Farming Protocols
AI models could optimize user investments across different yield farming strategies by dynamically shifting assets based on predicted yields.
4. Advanced AI Models for Liquidity Pool Optimizations
Integrate more sophisticated AI models capable of predicting price slippage and making real-time adjustments to liquidity pools.
